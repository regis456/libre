The goal of this project is to provide a ride-share app that is not orginized by a for-profit corporation. For-profit companies produce a wealthy elite off of the backs of other hardworking individuals. I see this project as a way to empower thousands of people and give them actual choice and agency of themselves. I am not the most experienced and all of my peers have no interest because there is potentially no compensation for their efforts. Being faced witht this ethical dilemma I will try my best to do this alone but I would greatly appreciate community help and support. I do not know if this will even go anywhere because people don't seem to care about their freedoms and more about convienience...Please use all or part of this code as you see fit. In the name of freedom and free software I hope that if I can't make this a dream, maybe someone can take it all and use it to actually make a difference in the world.
